# Only-Time-MAUI

## Why was it created?
My goal was to create a presentable and attractive timer for use on my Windows 10. But in addition to the timer, I also added a stopwatch, clock, and alarm clock.

## Program structure:
┣ Clock  
┣ Timer  
&nbsp;&nbsp;┣ Setting the time on the timer  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;┣ Timer operation, i.e., countdown  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;┗ Completion of work timer   
┣ Stopwatch - with Start, Stop, and Reset functions.  
┣ Alarm clock  
&nbsp;&nbsp;┣ Setting the alarm time  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;┣ Display of current time  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;┗ Completion of work alarm clock
